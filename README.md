Ahh Tech Degree #8. We learned AJAX in this unit and the project involved using Promises to acquire the information about random people (representing faux employees) from an external server and using Object Literal destructuring to display it to the page. Treehouse supplied the syntax for the promises and the destructring and some base html. So I didnt get as much practice as would have liked. Still was my quickest completion and highest point of confidence in the Treehouse course.

1. The Promise code supplied by Treehouse had a gotcha, which I fixed by saving the data results to a variable called employees. Which allowed me to pass it to  the next function to write it to the page.

2. We implemented a modal which selects the closest employee card to the user click, to display and had to add navigation controls to the modal to display the next employees like an image gallery. I got a hung up on this one as I couldnt get the modal to continuously loop through all the employee cards, but I fixed by saying if this is last in the index, next is first in index. Easy right? right?

3.For the search and modal I just re-used code from earlier projects.

The Project

We learned AJAX in this unit and the project involved using Promises to acquire the information about random people (representing faux employees) from an external server and using Object Literal destructuring to display it to the page. Each employeyee had information displayed in a grid of "cards" which will focus on a chosen employees and display their information. Treehouse supplied the syntax for the promises and the destructuring and some base html. 

The Process

1. The Promise code supplied by Treehouse had a gotcha, which I fixed by saving the data results to a variable called employees. Which allowed me to pass it to  the next function to write it to the page.

2. We implemented a modal which selects the closest employee card to the user click, to display and had to add navigation controls to the modal to display the next employees like an image gallery. The modal had to have the functionality to navigate through the list of employees using arrow buttons and start over once the user got to end. For example start on employee 1 and to be able to navigate back to employee 1 with the arrows. We had used a plugin to achieve this earlier in the course but realized I wrote my own simplified version of it for this project! Very cool.

3. There was a simple search bar which I re-used code from an earlier project.
